# Cardano (ADA)

Cardano is an Ethereum challenger and was created in 2015 by Charles Hoskinson, who was one of the founders of [Ethereum](/cryptocurrencies/ethereum.html).

Cardano is not only a cryptocurrency, but also a platform for [smart contracts](/technology/smart-contracts.html). Just like Ethereum, but with modern technology that in the future will have much higher speeds.

The project has a fantastic team, and it is run in a scientific and academic way. That is, all code that eventually becomes part of the product is reviewed and tested properly. This means that development is sometimes slower than expected, but it also provides a code base that radiates quality.

## Advantages

-   Academic and scientific methodology.
-   Many good partnerships.
-   Good team, good developers.
-   They have separated smart contracts in their own layer, which makes several things easier.
-   [Proof of Stake](/technology/proof-of-stake.html) instead of [Proof of Work](/technology/proof-of-work.html), which is faster. However, Ethereum will also implement this in the future.

## Disadvantages

-   Own programming language for smart contracts called Plutus, which is good but makes it difficult for developers to jump into.
-   Development can sometimes be slow because they have a scientific approach. The project will not be ready until 2020.
-   Still a rather slow platform with similar problems as Ethereum.
-   No support for anonymous / secret transactions.

## Buying

They can buy BNB (Binance Coin) with a credit card on it [Binance](https://www.binance.com) and then buy Cardano for these. Alternatively, buy Ethereum at [CoinBase](https://www.coinbase.com/), move these to Binance, and then switch ETH to ADA (Cardano).
