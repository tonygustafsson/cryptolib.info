# TRON (TRX)

Official webpage https://tron.network/

Tron is based in Singapore and saw the light of day in 2017 with Justin Sun as founder. They have been good at marketing and have made a number of decisions that have made them stand out (For example, a partnership with Pornhub).

The ambition is to focus on media, such as streaming video, but do so in a decentralized way. You bought the BitTorrent client for a large sum of money and see in front of you that you get BTT (Bittorrent Token) to share content, which you can then spend on other media content.

It supports [smart contracts](/technology/smart-contracts.html), and has many gambling sites that use TRON. There is also support for other tokens on top of TRON, just as [Ethereum](/cryptocurrencies/ethereum.html) did with ERC-20.

## Advantages

-   Good at marketing - they are heard and seen.
-   They work against censorship and are because individuals own their own data.
-   Fast transactions, they claim to handle 2000 transactions per second.

## Disadvantages

-   You easily get the feeling that the project is something frivolous, and has been accused of twisting code and plagiarizing whitepapers. Those who use the currency are also dubious industries.
-   No support for anonymous / secret transactions.

## Buying

They can buy BNB (Binance Coin) with a credit card on it [Binance](https://www.binance.com) and then buy TRX for these. Alternatively, buy Ethereum at [CoinBase](https://www.coinbase.com/), move these to Binance, and then switch ETH to TRX (Tron).
