# Social networks

You can of course go your own way and keep track of which projects are interesting and not with, for example, [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/). But it is very rewarding to see what others think and talk to other interested people.

Here is a list of common social networks in the blockchain sphere.

-   [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com) is by far the largest in the cryptosphere. See [a list of big tweeters in the sphere](https://medium.com/@Uttoken.io/top-50-blockchain-and-crypto-twitter-accounts-to-follow-3a343948d176)
-   [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) is an encrypted chat with various chat rooms / channels you can visit. Most cryptocurrencies have their own channel, sometimes for news but usually also to strengthen their community.
-   [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) is a forum that is very popular with people interested in crypto.
-   [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) is common for people interested in crypto to follow. Examples of popular Youtubers are [Ivan on Tech](https://www.youtube.com/user/LiljeqvistIvan/featured), [Modern Investor](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-5HLi3buMzdxjdTdic3Aig) [DataDash](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCatR7nWbYrkVXdxXb4cGXw/videos), [The Crypto Lark](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl2oCaw8hdR_kbqyqd2klIA) and [CryptoZombie](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiUnrCUGCJTCC7KjuW493Ww).
-   PodCasts are not a social networks, but a common way to share information and news. Popular podcasts are [Unchained](https://unchainedpodcast.com/), [Coin Mastery](https://www.coinmastery.com/) and [Bad Crypto Podcast](https://badcryptopodcast.com/).
