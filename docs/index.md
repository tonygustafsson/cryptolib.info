# Crypto Library

![Crypto Library logotype](/img/cryptolib.webp 'Crypto Library logotype')

The purpose of this website is to inform curious folks about cryptocurrencies. The website is independent in that the information should not encourage specific cryptocurrencies or exchanges in front of others. Most websites today have hidden agendas where they try to sell memberships to visitors or attract investors that benefit them - something we distance ourselves from.

Here you will find information about specific currencies, the technology behind them, about [exchanges](/market/exchanges.html) and [trading](/market/trading). You will also find information about [terminology](/terminology.html) and how you can find more useful information.

You can also find this website and all information below on [GitHub](https://github.com/tonygustafsson/cryptolib.info). We also welcome you as a contributor to the project. If you want, you can [donate](/donations.html) a satoshi or two to encourage the site's survival and development.
