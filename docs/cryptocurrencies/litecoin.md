Litecoin was created in 2011 by Charlie Lee, and is a fork on [Bitcoin](/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin.html). The idea is a coin that is faster, easier and cheaper to use. Litecoin is often seen as the little brother of Bitcoin, and it is a platform where new technology for Bitcoin is usually tried first.

## Advantages

-   Faster than Bitcoin.
-   Cheaper than Bitcoin.
-   One of the first altcoins on the market.
-   Ability to run [Lightning Network](/technology/lightning-network.html) which makes transactions lightning fast and almost free.

## Disadvantages

-   Mostly a variant of Bitcoin, there is not really much creativity and unique features in the project.
-   Charlie Lee sold all his litecoins in 2017 - according to him for not having personal interests in the project. But some interpret it as meaning that he no longer believes in his own project.
-   No support for anonymous / secret transactions.
-   No support for [smart contracts](/technology/smart-contracts.html) or distributed apps.

## Buying

They can be purchased directly by credit card or bank transfer at [CoinBase](https://www.coinbase.com/).
